# 20231012


I'm trying to figure out my ipv6 issues and it is *hard*. I've prepped the following message to the openwrt team:

```
Warning: I am choosing to make things harder on myself for the sake of learning and have reached my limit.

**Context**:

My ISP provides a /64 prefix by default and I successfully configured openwrt to request and receive a /60.

**Setup**:

Here is my planned setup:

* 2001:dad:add:dad::/60: main /60 prefix assigned by my ISP
** 2001:dad:add:dad:340::/64: my main LAN subnet
** 2001:dad:add:dad:341::/64: another routed subnet dedicated to K8s internal use
*** 2001:dad:add:dad:cafe:0::/96: subnet for pods
*** 2001:dad:add:dad:cafe:1::/96
**** 2001:dad:add:dad:cafe:1::/112: subnet for services

**Status**:

* 2001:dad:add:dad:340::1 -> 2001:dad:add:dad:341::457 (in a container) does not receive a response for neighbor solicitation
    * node receives the neighbor solicitation
    * 2001:dad:add:dad:341::457 is in the ip -6 neighbor output
    * 2001:dad:add:dad:341::457 is in the ip -6 route output with the lxc of the pod
* 2001:dad:add:dad:341::457 (node 1) -> 2001:dad:add:dad:341::789 (node 2) works

**Question**:

How am I supposed to configure the openwrt router to search for
**References**:

I've been following https://yolops.net/k8s-dualstack-cilium.html which has a small note of "that is routed by my router" which I can't figure out how to implement.
