# 20230904 - A new day, a new idea

So I installed Home Assistant OS onto my udoo disk by:

1. Download the image per the home assistant os instructions
2. Extract the image with `xz -v -d /path/to/haos_generic-x86-64-10.5.img.xz`
3. Dump the image to the disk. I triple checked that I had the right device. Using the output of `sudo fdisk -l` I
   determined that my primary disk was a `/dev/nvme0` and the USB disk was `/dev/sda` based on the size of the devices.
4. I got the image booted up and determined that I can't ssh into it. I learned from
   <https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system> that the OS is a buildroot which means it doesn't have any
   ability to install packages.

Then I came across [1] which talks about running home assistant os on fedora which piqued my interest. So maybe I'll
give that a try instead. Reading about the difference between Fedora IoT and Fedora CoreOS I think I'll try running it
on Fedora CoreOS.

After realizing that all of the services would be hosted in containers, I thought, why not run it in kubernetes? And so
now I'm full circle to just running everything in kubernetes. This time though, I'm going to use node attributes (can't
think of the right word) to ensure certain pods are deployed to certain nodes. Then I can expose any necessary devices
that are specific to that node.

So I plan to copy from [this blog post][2] and , [this blog post][3] both of whom are very good writers.

So, I think I'll take an approach of:

* Fedora CoreOS kubernetes nodes on my SBCs
* Node labels for hardware specific features like usb devices or bluetooth
* IPv6 native kubernetes because I've always IPv6 native resources. I'm just worried about protecting IPv6 systems from
  the internet. Maybe it's stupid of me to be concerned.

So, I'm going to follow the [podman blogpost][2] to prepare my Fedora CoreOS configuration files.

```yaml
variant: fcos
version: 1.4.0
passwd:
  users:
    - name: core
      ssh_authorized_keys:
      - ssh-ed25519 AA... # UPDATE THIS
      groups:
      - wheel
      - sudo
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/hostname
      mode: 0644
      contents:
        inline: hostname  # Optional: change this
    - path: /etc/zincati/config.d/51-rollout-wariness.toml
      contents:
        inline: |
          [identity]
          rollout_wariness = 0.75
    - path: /etc/zincati/config.d/55-updates-strategy.toml
      contents:
        inline: |
          [updates]
          strategy = "periodic"
          [[updates.periodic.window]]
          days = [ "Sat", "Sun" ]
          start_time = "22:45"
          length_minutes = 120
```

Oh look, I found [another post][4] with an even better butane file:

```yaml

      ssh_authorized_keys:

      groups:
      - wheel
      - sudo
    - name: ansible_svc

Now that I have a configuration file, I can convert it to an ignition file using a butane container.
