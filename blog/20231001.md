Today I successfully configured flux with applications and learned:

* I need a cert-manager configuration for generating certificates. So I decided to use cert-manager-webhook-henet
* I can't encrypt everything in a helmrelease.yaml file so I only encrypted some fields using the `--regex` parameter
* I updated the cert-manager-webhook-henet to newer versions
