I've put this project down for a bit as I focused on other aspects of my life like work and family. I have been slowly
but surely adding Z-Wave switches to my home that are controlled by Home Assistant. I also acquired a Athom Garage Door
opener, also controlled by Home Assistant.

## Athom Garage Door Opener
The Athom Garage Door Opener was unexpectedly difficult to set up but after learning a little more I understand why. For
anyone coming across this, the problem I was encountering was that I was unable to join it to my hidden wifi network
dedicated for internet of things devices. Some google searches led me to learn there is a parameter I can pass to the
embedded ESP device to tell it to connect to hidden wifi networks.

Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to configure the device based on what I was reading. I realized that I needed to
have an ESPHome service to give me the desired functionality. The ESPHome service is delivered as an Add-On for Home
Assistant but add-ons cannot be used with home assistant in a container. Therefore I'm planning to add an esphome
service to my kubernetes cluster to see if that gives me more control.

## Z-Wave

I decided to use z-wave instead of wifi or zigbee for my "smart" switches because it operates in the ~900 MHz range
instead of the 2.4GHz range which has already given me trouble in wifi.

It feels a little limiting compared to zigbee or wifi but I like that it has a potentially more reliable wavelength.
