Today I worked on bootstrapping the k3s cluster configuration some more. I have automated the bootstrapping of cilium
and coredns and kube-vip thanks to the flux-cluster-template.

I decided to run the kubernetes ansible tasks on my ansible controller instead of the k8s node so I don't have to
install the python modules.

Next I'll work on configuring sops and age. It feels like I'm close to setting up GitOps.
