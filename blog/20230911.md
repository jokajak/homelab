Today I successfully configured a k3s primary controller and an agent.

Woohoo!

Then I started to consider flux and came across <https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template/> which looks way more
complete than anything I've tried to build so far. Oh well, it's the journey, not the destination or something.

I'm trying to parse through the code to figure out how they bootstrap the services. But I did notice they remove the
`server/manifests` helm charts once things are installed.

## Services

* [ ] Home Assistant
* [ ] Task management, something like kanboard, or maybe gitea
* [ ] Photoprism because it has AI-powered facial detection
* [ ] grafana for graphing things
* [ ] loki for log aggregation
* [ ] unifi for AP management
* [ ] wireguard for secure remote access

## Desired outcomes

This section keeps track of what I want to do with my homelab:

* [ ] Automatic camera backup from phones with web frontend
* [ ] HVAC usage tracking (will be tough)
* [ ] Malicious ad protection
* [ ] Web content filtering via DNS filtering
* [ ] web content aggregation like with tinytinyrss or similar
* [ ] irc proxy
* [ ] home inventory management
* [ ] home project management

## Tasks/topics

* [ ] Note posting
* [x] Ansible bootstrapping
* [ ] Ansible AWX integration?
* [x] k3s bootstrapping
* [ ] gitops approach
* [ ] configuration encryption
