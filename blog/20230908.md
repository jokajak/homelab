# 20230908

Yesterday I realized that I can't deploy k3s from ignition because it doesn't set up the cluster with a known master.

So instead I'll use ansible to orchestrate the k3s cluster. I'll borrow code from
<https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible/>

## Services

* [ ] Home Assistant
* [ ] Task management, something like kanboard, or maybe gitea
* [ ] Photoprism because it has AI-powered facial detection
* [ ] grafana for graphing things
* [ ] loki for log aggregation
* [ ] unifi for AP management
* [ ] wireguard for secure remote access

## Desired outcomes

This section keeps track of what I want to do with my homelab:

* [ ] Automatic camera backup from phones with web frontend
* [ ] HVAC usage tracking (will be tough)
* [ ] Malicious ad protection
* [ ] Web content filtering via DNS filtering
* [ ] web content aggregation like with tinytinyrss or similar
* [ ] irc proxy
* [ ] home inventory management
* [ ] home project management

## Tasks/topics

* [ ] Note posting
* [x] Ansible bootstrapping
* [ ] Ansible AWX integration?
* [x] k3s bootstrapping
* [ ] gitops approach
* [ ] configuration encryption
