Today I rediscovered the complexities related to bootstrapping.

I finally managed to get the authentik helm chart to deploy but it required manual actions:

* postgres user password wasn't set even though the `superuserSecret` was set in the cluster configuration
* authentik wouldn't start because it kept trying to use a redis backend that wasn't a master. So I killed the redis
node that wasn't a master
