Today I finally realized how the cloud native pg could be used. There seem to be three different approaches:

* A single cluster for all services
* A cluster per service
* Somewhere in between

My preference is to have a single cluster for all services with multiple databases within the cluster. This way the
number of pods running the database service are reduced which aligns better with the nodes in my cluster. It does mean
the cluster is more important to the rest of the services but that is acceptable to me.

Another issue with a single cluster for all services is that I need some mechanism to create databases within the
cluster for new services. This is where the onedr0p/postgres-init container comes in handy because it contains a
entrypoint that initializes a database.
