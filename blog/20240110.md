# 20240110

I've decided that I need to replace my foyer system with a more power system because the 1GB node keeps crashing because
I haven't resource constrained it properly.

With my new system I want to play around with talos which means I get to recreate my entire cluster because they can't
coexist with other systems. Goodbye Fedora CoreOS!

I found [talhelper](https://budimanjojo.github.io/talhelper/latest/getting-started/) which purports to make it easier. I
like the idea of declaratively configuring my k8s nodes encrypted in the git repository. It aligns with GitOps and maybe
I'll be able to use terraform to manage them too (shrug).

To start, I need to install the required applications:

```shell
brew install talhelper  # it's not in pkgx :(
brew install sops  # it's not in pkgx :(
curl -sL https://talos.dev/install | sh  # to install talosctl
```

I could try to migrate the existing cluster to talos per [this
guide](https://www.talos.dev/v1.6/advanced/migrating-from-kubeadm/) but I feel like with flux and persistent storage on
the NAS, it's a good opportunity to verify and document my disaster recovery process.

So I'll start with setting up the new control node with talos and getting flux working on it.

## Cluster Setup

Following the [talhelper getting-started](https://budimanjojo.github.io/talhelper/latest/getting-started/), I'll need to
create a new cluster configuration. I don't want to expose my IP CIDRs so I'll have to use sops to encrypt that file
too.

I found [clustertool](https://github.com/truecharts/clustertool) which looks like it's a helpful tool to learn from. I
like that it includes an encrypted `talenv.yaml` file for controlling execution of talhelper and the `talconfig.yaml`
file.

From `clustertool` I will do some general improvements:

* introduce an encrypted age key
* update the `.gitignore` file
