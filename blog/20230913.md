I figured out how the flux cluster template works:

1. Generate ansible inventory that supplies the configuration for the k3s role.
2. Run the k3s role to setup k3s
3. Remove the bootstrap manifests. This step is so that they are not reinstalled when the service starts up again.
4. Use flux to install functional services.
5. Use renovatebot to keep things up to date.

This seems like I'm on the right path, I just need to pull some configurations over and follow the same pattern. I'm
disappointed I need to have the flux agent installed but oh well.
