Today I successfully set up the zwavejs ui which required all of these things to be setup first:

* internal ingress controller which required
* cert-manager which required
* updated cert-manager-webhook-henet
* persistent volume claims which required
* csi-driver-nfs

I figured out I can configure my router to forward *.${SECRET_DOMAIN}  to my k8s-gateway while still resolving locally
defined hosts. Seems like a win-win situation. I had to set my ${SECRET_DOMAIN} as allowing RFC1918 responses.

I also used <https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/hr/> to find things

<https://github.com/ChristfriedBalizou/homelab/blob/main/kubernetes/apps/storage/synology/app/service.yaml> is an
example of proxying for an external service.
