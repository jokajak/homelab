Today I realized I like to do things the hard way.

I started to set up loki and started to copy from <https://github.com/billimek/k8s-gitops/blob/master/logs/README.md>

I realized that configuration depended on using minio. So I considered not following it but decided that I liked the
idea of having a highly available logging stack. So then I started down the path of setting up minio (which I haven't
quite gotten to the bottom of).

While trying to figure out how to set up minio, I saw that the billimek k8s-gitops uses a statically defined PV and PVC
that use the [nfs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs) persistent volume. This led me to summarize
my understanding of the different storage providers for kubernetes related to nfs:

* nfs: kubernetes native storage that can mount a NFS share into pod
* [csi-driver-nfs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs): kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) that
  can create a new directory within an existing NFS share or create a new NFS share. It names the new directory using an
  algorithm that ends up with pvc-$UUID
* [nfs-subdir-external-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner): kubernetes is
an automatic provisioner that uses existing NFS servers to support dynamic provisioning of PV and PVCs.
