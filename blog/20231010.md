So, today I did a neat thing when bitwarden-cli wasn't starting up (super frustrating).

1. Create a configmap with a new entrypoint.sh for the container
2. Modify the deployment to mount the entrypoint.sh to /var/lib/test/
3. Modify the deployment to call the /var/lib/test/entrypoint.sh

This allowed me to debug the container and discover it was a IPv6 problem:

```shell
+ bw config server ''
Could not find dir, "/root/.config/Bitwarden CLI"; creating it instead.
Could not find data file, "/root/.config/Bitwarden CLI/data.json"; creating it instead.
+ bw login --apikey
request to https://identity.bitwarden.com/connect/token failed, reason: connect EHOSTUNREACH 2606:4700::6812:c21:443++ bw unlock --passwordenv BW_PASSWORD --raw

+ export BW_SESSION
+ bw unlock --check

```
