# 20230906

Today I discovered that I wasn't done bootstrapping my kubernetes cluster. I had several issues with my configuration:

* the node cidr size wasn't consistent between the defined cidrs and the defaults
* passing the node cidr size wasn't as straight forward, it had to be defined in the kube-controller-manager-arg
attribute
* my cni had to be installed before the node would become ready. I decided to use the k3s helm support to install it
automatically on server setup. This required setting the `bootstrap: true` flag in the specification.
